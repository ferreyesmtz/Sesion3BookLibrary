The Library Management System is a Java-based console application designed to assist librarians and library staff in managing their library's collection of books. This program provides a simple interface for performing essential operations related to the management of books, patrons, and borrowing activities.

Key Features
1. Book Management:
o Add Books: Librarians can add new books to the library's inventory by
entering details such as the title, author, ISBN, and the number of copies
available.
o Remove Books: Allows the removal of books from the inventory if they
are no longer available or needed.
o Display Books: Users can view a list of all books in the library, including
their details, helping to keep track of the collection.
2. Patron Management:
o Register Patrons: The system allows librarians to register new patrons,
capturing essential information like name, ID, and contact details.
o View Patrons: Librarians can view a list of registered patrons, making it
easier to manage user information.
3. Borrowing and Returning Books:
o Borrow Books: Patrons can borrow books from the library, and the
system will track which books are currently checked out and which are
available.
o Return Books: Patrons can return books they have borrowed, updating
the inventory accordingly and allowing other patrons to borrow those
books.
4. Search Functionality:
o The system allows users to search for books by title, author, or ISBN,
making it easy to find specific books in the library's collection.
5. User-Friendly Interface:
o The application features a simple text-based menu that guides users
through the available operations. This design makes it accessible for
users with varying levels of technical expertise.
Educational Objectives
This project aims to teach students the following key concepts:
• Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Students will learn how to create and
use classes and objects, encapsulate data, and model real-world entities (like
books and patrons).
• Data Structures: The program will utilize data structures (like lists or arrays) to
manage collections of books and patrons efficiently.
• Input and Output Handling: Students will gain experience in handling user input
and displaying output in a console application.
Internal• Basic Algorithm Design: Students will implement algorithms for searching,
adding, and removing items from collections, enhancing their problem-solving
skills.
